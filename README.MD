## Summary
This website was a comission from TSP Data, a.s. to create an attractive landing page for their state-of-the-art Observability solution for businesses who want to become more data oriented, want to prevent issues before they happen and stay on track of things.

This was my first website where I had comprehensive brand guidelines to work with, created by a designer studio. This made things simple in some ways but more difficult in some others. It made me have a good idea of how everything should look, but I also had to make sure to keep to the rules set by these guidelines.

## What I've learned
- Turns out webkit and older browsers don't play along with vanilla CSS nesting and @media query *< >* symbols - this made the website completely broken on my testing iPhone 6s (Thanks Va≈°ek for giving it to me!), but after changing it to a non-nested version everything worked perfectly.
- I've learned more about how to use local fonts and how to import them with CSS.
- The more whitespace I used, the more airy and nicer the website looked, which I had never before realised how important that was!
- I spent quite a bit of time *trying* to SEO optimize the site as much as possible, and learned a lot more about meta tags, that there are WAY more tags than I thought and how to use them to have a nicer search result in google, a nicer URL when posted to places like discord and how to make sites more SEO optimized in general.
- Most of my development time was spent making the design in Figma, and the coding took a considerably shorter amount of time than I expected and in general my time estimate for the project was very generous and I managed to complete it in much less time than anticipated.

## Summary
This was an awesome project, and I'm super happy with the final result! This is my first commercial project that I've completed, and I think it turned out nicely, and it was also well received by the comissioner. However, I still had issues implementing some CSS due to insufficient knowledge, and I'll need to vastly improve my knowledge on JavaScript and PHP so I can also create backends for these sites, and add more animations and make cooler designs in the future. And learn more about SEO aswell :D
